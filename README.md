## Overview

GitHub WebApp is a web application that allows users to create GitHub repositories, add files to them, and collaborate with contributors. This project features a React-based frontend and a Flask-based backend, with the primary goal of serving as a learning exercise to explore new technologies and development techniques.

## Features

- **Create GitHub Repository**: Users can create a new GitHub repository by providing a name, description, and privacy settings.

- **Add Files**: Once a repository is created, users can add files to it. Supported languages include Python, Java, C, C++, and JavaScript.

- **Collaborate with Contributors**: Users can invite collaborators to their repositories, allowing them to contribute code.


## Usage

Access the web application by opening your browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000 (assuming the React development server is running).

Use the GitHub WebApp to create repositories, add files, and invite collaborators.

## Browser Compatibility
This website is currently optimized for use with the Mozilla Firefox web browser. While it may work in other browsers, I recommend using Firefox for the best experience.
